                            <div class="modal-bodys">
                                <p>1. Most southern states created laws that limited former slaves from traveling, voting and working in certain jobs. For example, before reconstruction was taken over by Republicans in congress, the south were allowed to pass the black codes to restrict rights that were given to freed people.</p>
                                <p>2. Ku Klux Klan was a group of people who wore robes and masks and pretended to be the ghosts of the Confederate soldiers. They were scared of changes, and the rising rights of the African Americans, who they wanted to be labourers and slaves. So, they attacked them, usually by putting their homes on fire. This made new freed people scared of using the rights that they were given.</p>
                                <p>3. Unfortunately, the jobs that they had were limited because non of them had skills to offer. This made them go back to taking care of the field, which was like being a slave again. These jobs were called sharecropping and tenant farming, which was corrupt and actually hurt these newly freed people.</p>
                                <p>4.Jim Crow's Laws, which created segregation against blacks and counted it as equal. For example: A black person in jail cannot have a cell next to a white person. As will as a black peron could not go to school with a white person.</p>
